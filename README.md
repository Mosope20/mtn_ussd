Project Structure
The project is structured using nested dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a menu or submenu with key-value pairs for each option.

first_dict: Main menu options, accessible by dialing *131#.
Submenu dictionaries (e.g., BuyData, SocialBundle, etc.) for each main menu option.
How to Use
Run the Python script.
Enter the USSD code *131# to access the main menu.
Follow the prompts by typing the number of your chosen option (e.g., 1 for Data Plans).
For submenus, type the corresponding number to navigate further or type 0 to go back.
